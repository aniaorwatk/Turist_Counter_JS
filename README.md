## Technologies: 
JS • HTML5 • CSS

## About the project: 
Counter of tourists entering the mountain trail • By clicking on the "increment" button, we add one tourist. 
The result is displayed above the button • By clicking on the "save" button, we save the number of entries 
and we can count the entries again, e.g. after a coffee break (: • I used "if" to separate the numbers when writing them
